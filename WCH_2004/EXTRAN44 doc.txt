*       <<<<<<<<  SWMM 4.4H EXTRAN DATA FILE >>>>>>>>>
*
*
*       February 2001
*       New D2 and D3 lines.
*       General clean-up of this file by Chuck Moore and Wayne Huber.
*       July 20, 2004. Minor change for TOLCS1 variable and for
*       DEEP and WIDE variables for conduits 9, 10, 11.  
*       Option for three different spatial weighting, new AA line.  
*
*       This is an input data file to the SWMM 4.4H (CDM/OSU) Extran Block
*       for modeling the hydraulics of sewer or open channel systems.
*       All lines with an asterisk in column 1 are comment lines
*       and are ignored by the program.  All information following
*       an asterisk on an input line are considered to be comments also.
*       The user should get in the habit if using asterisks to separate
*       data from comments.
*
*       Input data are free format and may be up to 230 columns wide.
*       You must have a value for every data column even if the program
*       will not actually use a given value.  There must be at least one
*       space or comma between every input value.  Alphanumeric data must
*       be enclosed in single quotes.
*
*       Caution!  Data lines that are "wrapped around" (continued on
*       two or more lines) should have a blank in column 1, unless a
*       card identifier is needed.
*
*       In general, SWMM parameters with names that begin with the letters
*       I,J,K,L,M,N are integers (e.g., NSCRAT() ), following the usual
*       Fortran convention, and entered values must not include a
*       decimal point.
*
*       To avoid literary quotes being printed in output, use $NOQUOTE
*       after MM line.
*
*       SWMM uses both U.S. customary units and metric units.  The
*       examples use feet, cfs, acres, inches and inches/hour.  If metric
*       is specified substitute meters, cms, hectares, millimeters and
*       millimeters/hour.  If metric is used, internal computations in
*       the Extran Block are also performed in metric units.
*============================================================================
*       The SW card sets up the interface files to be used or created.  In 
*       this example there is one output file (#8) that will contain the 
*       time series of flows for subsequent blocks.
*       By default, this file contains flows at all outfalls at
*       each time step.  If you don't need this output, leave JOUT equal
*       to zero to avoid writing results to scratch file which is
*       is subsequently erased.  If INTER is entered as a negative number,
*       then detailed output of model configuration, depths, and flows
*       are written to the file associated with JOUT in ASCII format.
*
*       Extran does not perform pollutant routing.  If pollutants are
*       included on an input interface file, they are ignored.
*============================================================================
*  NBLOCK  JIN(1)  JOUT(1)
SW    1      0       8
*============================================================================
*   The MM card opens the scratch files to be used by different subroutines.
*   A certain number (up to 8 for Extran) may be required for each block.
*  NSCRAT(1) - Save results for summary output (unformatted sequential)
*  NSCRAT(2) - Hot start input and output file (unformatted sequential)
*  NSCRAT(3) - B9 writing of flows at specified conduits (ASCII or
*    unformatted sequential)
*    Note, must define NSCRAT(3) with @-line if use B9 line option.
*  NSCRAT(4) - Read and write irregular channel data to scratch file
* NSCRAT(5) - Read tidal history data from ASCII file
* NSCRAT(8) - Write EPA CEAM WASP (Water Analysis Simulation Program) model 
*    hydrodynamic input file (.HYD).

*============================================================================
*     The @ command is used to save an interface or scratch file
*     permanently, or to access a previously saved file.  This line should
*     be placed before the first SWMM block call.  The format of the @
*     command is as follows:
*============================================================================
*Column 1    Unit number of the       Name of the interface
*            interface file saved     file (any valid DOS filename)
*            or utilized              associated with this unit number.
*
*@             8                        'EXDOC.DNT'
* Note, must define DOS name for NSCRAT(3) when using B9 option.
@              3                        'scrat3.sav'
*     If file names are not defined on the @ line, the program will attempt
*     to read the file names from the command line. For example, enter the
*     following at the dos prompt, in the batch file, or on the Windows run
*     line to run swmm.exe, read input from IN.DAT, write output to OUT.OUT,
*     and save JOUT = 8 output to EXDOC.INT.
*       SWMM IN.DAT OUT.OUT EXDOC.INT
*============================================================================
*Column 1
* $ANUM  ==> Use alphanumeric names for Extran conduits and junctions.
*            If used in one block, then alphanumeric must be used in all
*            prior and subsequent blocks.  Names (IDs) must be enclosed in
*            single quotes.  Names can include up to 10 characters.
*            When using default output tables, a maximum length of 6
*            characters is recommended, although most 10-character names will
*            print satisfactorily.  This Version 4.4GU includes options *            to provide alternative output tables that will print all
*            10 digits or characters of the file names (see JP10 input on BA
*            card.
*============================================================================
*Column 1
* $NOQUOTE ==> Omit on-screen and printed literary quotations in SWMM output.
*============================================================================
$EXTRAN         Call the Extran Block with a '$' in first column.
*============================================================================
*       Create title lines for the simulation.  There are two title lines
*       for the Extran Block.  Titles are enclosed in single quotes.

*
*         The following are required only if ISOL is greater than 2.

*       TOLCS1  : =    Maximum steady state flow imbalance to control when
*                      model is in steady state conditions expressed as follows:
*                      IF [ABS(QOUT-QIN) < ABS(TOLCS1*QIN)] then steady state
*                      conditions prevail.
*                      Note: to avoid printout of many change of status

*               if necessary, but must have DELT >= 1 sec.  Values < 5 sec
*               should be avoided if possible by using equivalent conduits 
*               to avoid violation of Courant stability condition.
*       TZERO : Start time of simulation, decimal hours.  Time zero
*               is midnight (beginning) of first simulation day.
*
*               If inflows to model are provided on interface file

*
*       IDATZ : Initial date of simulation, 8 digits,
*               YYYYMODY (e.g. 19970915).  If it is written at 970915 then
*               program will assume that date is 1997
*               Default is 19410802.
*               NOTE: If inflows are provided on interface file associated
*                     with JIN, then DATEZ on interface file is used for
*                     initial date.
*                 EXCEPT, if IDATZ is entered as negative number, this
*                 starting date will be used regardless of starting date
*                 on interface file.  This permits user to start at some
*                 intermediate date on interface file.  In this case
*                 the starting time on B1 line will also be used.

*
*                Not required for NKLASS 8.  For NKLASS 8, if DEEP is 
*                zero then the section depth is computed as the maximum 
*                cross section elevation minus the minimum cross section 
*                elevation.  If flows are not expected to equal the 
*                full-section depth, then entering DEEP less than the 
*                maximum section depth will cause only the bottom 
*                portion of the cross-section data to be used and may 
*                result in improved definition of the cross-section 
*                properties when section is subdivided into 25 
*                equal-depth segments. 
*
*                Optional for ellipse NKLASS 9 and 10 and arch 
*                NKLASS 11. Enter Size Code for standard sizes 
*                summarized in file SHAPE.DOC.TXT. 
*
*If DEEP and WIDE are entered as negative numbers for horizontal
*and vertical elliptical pipes, then the full-flow area (Afull) and
*full-flow hydraulic radius (Rfull) will be approximated as a
*function of the minor axis length (AMINOR) as follows :
*
*          Afull = 1.2692 * AMINOR * AMINOR
*          Rfull = 0.3061 * AMINOR
*
*If DEEP and WIDE are entered as negative numbers for arch pipes,
*the full flow area (Afull) and full flow hydraulic radius
*(Rfull) will be approximated as the following:
*
*          Afull = 0.7879 * DEEP * WIDE
*          Rfull = 0.2991 * DEEP
*
*     WIDE     : Maximum width of conduit, ft [m].
*                Bottom width for trapezoid, ft [m].
*                Top width for parabolic/power function, ft [m].
*                Not required (see above) for NKLASS 1,8,9,10, or 11.
*     LEN      : Length of conduit, ft [m]. 
*                For irregular channels NKLASS 8, by default LEN on the 
*                C1 line must equal LEN entered on the C3 or X1 line.  
*                See IWLEN on the BA line options to modify the input of 
*                length for irregular channels.
*
*                Note: A negative LEN(N) creates a flap gate
*                      that will only let water move from the
*                      upstream junction (higher elevation conduit invert)
*                      to the downstream junction (lower elevation conduit
*                      invert).  IF Q < 0 THEN Q = 0
*     ZP(1)    : Distance of conduit invert above junction invert
*                at NJUNC(1), ft [m].
*     ZP(2)    : Distance of conduit invert above junction invert
*                at NJUNC(2), ft [m].
*                Note: If JELEV on line BB is nonzero then ZP(1) and ZP(2)
*                      are actual elevations referenced to an absolute
*                      datum.
*     ROUGH    : Manning's N coefficient (should include entrance, exit,
*                expansion, and contraction losses if NEQUAL on line B2
*                equals 0 or 1).  Not required for NKLASS 8.  Uses XNCH in 
*                data group C2.
*     STHETA   : Slope of one side of trapezoid.  Required only for
*                NKLASS = 6, (horizontal/vertical; 0 = vertical walls).
*
*                For NKLASS 7, the channel exponent(2.0, 3.0, etc.).
*
*                For NKLASS 8, the cross-section identification number
*                (SECNO, group C3) of the cross section used for
*                this Extran channel.  Unlike HEC-2, Extran uses only
*                a single cross section to represent a natural
*                channel reach for NKLASS 8 channels.  A negative
*                STHETA(N) will eliminate the printing of the dimension-
*                less curves associated with each natural channel or
*                power-function channel.
*
*                For NKLASS 12, the bridge section identification number
*                (BRDGNO, group C5) of the bridge data input to use for
*                this Extran conduit.  Note: AFULL, DEEP, WIDE, AND ROUGH
*                are computed from bridge input data.
*
*                Alphanumeric inputs cannot be used for STHETA !!
*
*                For closed conduits (other than NKLASS 6, 7, 8, and 12),
*                STHETA can be used to limit the maximum negative flow
*                in a conduit.  Enter maximum negative flow as a negative
*                number.  Note that this is in the direction adopted by
*                Extran (i.e., negative flow is from end of conduit
*                with lower invert to end of conduit with higher invert).
*                Entering a positive flow may produce unexpected results.
*
*     SPHI     : Slope of other side of trapezoid. Required only for
*                NKLASS = 6, (horizontal/vertical; 0 = vertical walls).
*
*                The average channel slope for NKLASS 8 or 12.
*                This slope is used only for developing a rating
*                curve for the channel.  Routing calculations use invert
*                elevation differences divided by length.  If a slope
*                approximately equal to the true slope, or HGL slope
*                is used, than the capacities listed for the section will
*                approximate the actual capacity.
*
*                SPHI can also be used to limit the maximum positive
*                flow in a conduit.  For NKLASS other than 6, 8, 7, or 12
*                enter a non-zero SPHI to use this option.
*                The maximum flow in the conduit is then limited to
*                this value:  IF Q > SPHI THEN Q = SPHI
*                Note that positive flow in Extran is defined as flow
*                from end of the conduit with the higher invert elevation
*                to the end of the conduit with the lower invert elevation.
*                Entering a negative number may produce unexpected results.
*
*
*   The following parameters are read for closed conduits (NKLASS 1, 2,
*   3, 4, 5, 9, 10, and 11 when NEQUAL on card group B2 is set equal
*   to 2, 3, 4, or 5.  The loss coefficients are then incorporated into
*   the Manning's roughness value used for the conduit.  
*     ENTK     : Entrance loss coefficient.
*     EXITK    : Exit loss coefficient.
*     OTHERK   : Additional loss coefficient for losses other than entrance
*                and exit losses, e.g., expansions, contractions, bends
*                and valves.
*
*   The following parameter is read if IPIPESED on line BB is set equal 
*   to 1.  While it is read for all conduit shapes, this option works 
*   for only circular conduits in this version of the program.
*     SEDEPTH  : Depth of sediment in the conduit in feet.  Full depth, 
*                area, hydraulic radius, and flow capacity will be 
*                adjusted accordingly.  Conduit invert (ZP values) 
*                are adjusted for depth of sediment.  Conduit shape 
*                characteristics used to compute flow at partial depths
*                (e.g., curves relating area, hydraulic radius, and 
*                wetted perimeter to depth) are adjusted accordingly.  
*                JELEV does not affect this input.

*        The C2 (NC), C3 (X1), and C4 (GR) data lines are for any NKLASS 8
*   conduit.  They follow as a group after all C1 lines have been entered.
*   The sequence for channels must be in the same order that they appear 
*   on the C1 lines.  The same cross-sectional information on
*   lines C2-C4 can be used by more than one channel.  I.e., different
*   channels can have the same STHETA values. 
*
*        Data groups C2, C3 and C4 correspond to HEC-2 lines NC,
*   X1 and GR.  HEC-2 input may be used directly if desired.  Lines
*   may be identified either by Extran identifiers (C2, C3, C4) or
*   HEC-2 identifiers (NC, X1, GR).
*============================================================================
*        The C2 line is used to input natural channel roughness.
*   This is an optional data line that permanently modifies the Manning's
*   roughness coefficients (N) for the remaining natural channels.  This
*   data group may be repeated for later channels.  It must be included for
*   the first natural channel modeled.

*
*     X and Y location of junctions.  These are not used by Extran but
*     can be passed to graphical pre- and post-processors.
*     If they are not supplied, comments contained on the D1 line must
*     start with an asterisk.
*     XLOC     :   Junction X location
*     YLOC     :   Junction Y location
*     These need not be entered even if IWHICH is entered
*
*     IWHICH identifies which of the base flow SETS entered on the BD lines
*     to use for this junction.  The monthly base flow factor is multiplied
*     by QINST to determine the base flow at this location.  IWHICH
*     need not be entered.  If IWHICH is not entered and QINST is
*     greater than zero, the first groundwater set is used by default.
*     If no factors are entered on the BD lines, the factor is always
*     equal to 1.
*     IWHICH should not be entered if no BD lines are present.
*
*     SURELEV identifies the maximum surcharge level to which water levels
*     can rise.  This is used to represent conditions such as bolted manhole
*     lids where the hydraulic grade line can rise above the GRELEV.  If 
*     SURELEV is not entered or is entered as zero then GRELEV is used.  
*     If SURELEV is entered, then HGL levels will be allowed to rise above 
*     GRELEV up to a maximum as specified by SURELEV.
