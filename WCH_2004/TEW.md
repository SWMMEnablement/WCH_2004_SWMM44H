# TEW Module Documentation

This document provides an in-depth look at the TEW common block, originally written in Fortran for handling various simulation parameters. The code has been modified on 7/28/04 with the addition of two new integer variables: F7 and F8.

## Overview

The TEW common block aggregates several variables, including arrays and simple data types. It serves as a central data structure for storing time-based and formatting information. The module includes:

- Array variables storing time markers.
- A character variable for formatting.
- Integer flags and unit conversion identifiers.
- Two-dimensional arrays likely used for monthly and daily data breakdown.

## Detailed Variable Explanation

- **IYEND(3), IYBEG(3):** Arrays holding three elements each. Typically, these might represent the beginning and end of a time period.
- **FIRMAT:** A character variable (length 80) that likely stores format specifications.
- **KUNIT, CONV, KTYPE:** Integer values which probably control unit settings, conversion factors, or type codes.
- **PAN(12):** An array with 12 elements, possibly representing month-specific values.
- **IFORM, IO, NEWYR, ISTA:** Control variables for data input/output, yearly resets, or state indicators.
- **F1 to F8:** Integer variables used for various functional roles. Notably, F7 and F8 were added in the recent update.
- **METRIC:** An integer flag that might indicate whether metric units are employed.
- **BARAY(12,31), SARAY(12,31), WARAY(12,31), EARAY(12,31):** Two-dimensional arrays that likely represent data distributed by month (12 rows) and day (31 columns).

## Code Example

Below is the original Fortran snippet as found in the TEW.md file:

```fortran
Cwch, 7/28/04. Add F7 and F8.
      COMMON/TEW/IYEND(3),IYBEG(3),FIRMAT,KUNIT,CONV,KTYPE,PAN(12),
     *           IFORM,IO,NEWYR,ISTA,F1,F2,F3,F4,F5,F6,F7,F8,METRIC,
     *           BARAY(12,31),SARAY(12,31),WARAY(12,31),EARAY(12,31)
      CHARACTER FIRMAT*80
      INTEGER F1,F2,F3,F4,F5,F6,F7,F8
```

## Summary

The TEW module is integral to the software's data handling processes, combining both control and data storage elements. With a blend of integer variables and multidimensional arrays, it supports time-series processing, formatted output, and various control tasks. The update adding F7 and F8 demonstrates ongoing enhancements to the module. This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding the structure and purpose of each element within the common block.
