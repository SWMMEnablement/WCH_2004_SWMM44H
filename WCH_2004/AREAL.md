# Fortran Subroutine AREAL â€“ Complete Summary

This document provides a complete markdown version of the Fortran subroutine AREAL. The subroutine is designed to calculate the fraction of an area covered by snow (ASC), considering various scenarios such as complete snow cover, no snow, and transitions involving new snowfall. It also deals with switching between a regular depletion curve and a temporary depletion curve when new snow arrives.

## Overview
- **Purpose:**  
      Determine the fractional snow cover (ASC) using both existing and new snow information. It adjusts the depletion curve based on the presence of new snow and invokes linear interpolation (via FINDSC) to compute values along the depletion curve.

- **Key Parameters and Variables:**  
      - `WSNOW`: Total snow water content.
      - `SI`: A scaling factor used to compute ratios.
      - `NEWSNO`: Flag indicating if new snow is affecting the depletion curve.
      - `ASC`: Fraction of area covered by snow.
      - `ADC`: An array representing the depletion curve for ASC values.
      - `RIN`: Input representing rain or melt signal.
      - `DELT`: Time increment.
      - Other local variables like `AWESI`, `AWE`, `SBA`, and `SBWS` are used to manage intermediate computations.

## Logical Flow
1. **Complete Snow Coverage:**  
       - If `WSNOW` is less than `SI`, the entire area is considered snow-covered, setting `ASC` to 1.0 and `NEWSNO` to 0.

2. **No Snow Condition:**  
       - If `WSNOW` is not positive, the subroutine sets `ASC` to 0.0 indicating no snow.

3. **Normal Depletion Curve (without new snow):**  
       - When there is no new snowfall (`NEWSNO` equals 0) and the rain/melt signal (`RIN`) is not negative, the subroutine computes a ratio (`AWESI = WSNOW/SI`) and calls `FINDSC` to determine the proper interpolation on the regular depletion curve.
       
4. **Transition to Temporary Depletion Curve (new snowfall condition):**  
       - When the rain/melt signal is negative or a new snow condition is already flagged (`NEWSNO = 1`), it transitions to a temporary curve setup.
       - The amount of snow from the previous step is computed as `AWE = (WSNOW+RIN*DELT)/SI`. Values are bounded, and interpolation is performed via `FINDSC` to obtain the intermediate value `SBA`.
       - A secondary boundary `SBWS` is calculated to determine if the area still meets conditions for total snow cover or if a transition interpolation is needed.

5. **Reverting or Continuing on the Temporary Depletion Curve:**  
       - Further branching occurs, comparing the current state (`AWESI`) with previously computed thresholds (`AWE` and `SBWS`) to decide whether:
             - The system has moved back to the regular curve.
             - It remains on the temporary depletion curve.
       - Interpolations via `FINDSC` are performed as necessary to update the fraction `ASC` and flag `NEWSNO` accordingly.

## Detailed Code Structure
The subroutine is structured with labels (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60) to manage different branch conditions. Comments within the code offer additional context about adjustments made historically (e.g., changes on 1/23/04) and the intended behavior during new snowfall events versus steady depletion.
