## Introduction

The total number of extrapolated steps is a critical parameter within the simulation framework. This document elaborates on how these steps are computed, the rationale behind the extrapolation mechanism, and where to locate extended documentation or supporting materials.

---

## Overview

The mechanism for controlling extrapolated steps involves managing a count that drives further computational and analysis routines. The key points include:
- **Purpose**: To identify the number of extrapolation intervals needed.
- **Usage**: Passed to subsequent simulation processes for detailed analysis.
- **Location**: See the associated file path for extended documentation.

## Technical Details

### Code Block Explanation
The following code block (in C-style syntax) exemplifies the header description and outlines the role of the extrapolated steps documentation:

```c
/**
 * @brief Total Number of Extrapolated Steps Documentation
 *
 * This comment describes the macro or function section that manages the 
 * extrapolation of steps. It represents the total count of extrapolated 
 * steps necessary for subsequent processing or analysis.
 *
 * Note: The associated file path indicates where related documentation or 
 * data might be stored.
 */
```

This snippet encapsulates important commentary on the extrapolated step functionality. It details the brief purpose of the documentation and provides context for future developers.
