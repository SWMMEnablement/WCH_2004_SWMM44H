## Summary of EXTRAN.FOR
The EXTRAN subroutine implements the extended transport model simulation, continuously updated by several collaborators. It sets up transfer files, initializes variables, reads input data, and then runs the simulation. Key components include:

Header Documentation:

Lists the contributors and modifications by various organizations.
Mentions updates such as the "NO-QUOTE" option and initialization of specific arrays (QINN, QINNK3).
Included Files:

Multiple common block files are included (e.g., TAPES.INC, INTER.INC, STIMER.INC, BND.INC, BD.INC, CONTR.INC, JUNC.INC, ORF.INC, PIPE.INC, OUT.INC, TIDE.INC, and TRANAID.INC).
Transfer File Setup:

Increments counters and associates file handles with file names.
Writes initialization messages using formatted write statements.
Checks for a “NO-QUOTE” option to determine the proper message output.
Handles opening of scratch files versus persistent files based on file names (e.g., 'JOT.UF', 'JIN.UF', and various SCRT*.UF).
Variable Initialization:

Initializes numerous arrays (e.g., qsum, qisum, ICHECK, JCHECK, PMAX, QTOT, etc.) for each element and channel.
Loops to set initial simulation conditions, including values for flow and depth variables.
Initializes arrays used for channel counts and hydrodynamic parameters such as VORIF.
Input Data and Simulation Execution:

Calls subroutines INDAT1, INDAT2, and INDAT3 to load input data.
Initializes the simulation time and then calls the driver routine TRANSX (which likely uses a modified Euler solution).
After simulation, calls OUTPUT for reporting results and prints a termination message.
Formatting:

Contains several FORMAT statements for consistent and formatted output messages and warnings during file handling.
The subroutine is structured to perform the necessary setup for simulation, ensuring proper file management, initialization of the data arrays, and executing the simulation steps while providing informative console outputs.
