## Summary of the RDIISHED Fortran Subroutine

This file contains a Fortran subroutine named RDIISHED, originally created in August 1993 by C. Moore, CDM. The routine is designed to perform RDII (Rainfall-Derived Inflow and Infiltration) calculations for basins that use E5 cards.

### Key Components
- **Include Files:**  
      The subroutine uses several external include files to integrate required parameters and variable declarations:  
      - TAPES.INC  
      - STIMER.INC  
      - TIMER.INC  
      - DETAIL.INC  
      - SUBCAT.INC  
      - GRWTR.INC  
      - RDII.INC

- **Calculation Flow:**  
      - The subroutine begins by checking if the time interval (DEL2) is less than or equal to zero. If so, it calls the routine READNEXT and exits early.  
      - If DEL2 is positive, the routine calculates time intervals using the NTIME subroutine. The original call for the first interval is preserved, while the line being added at the placeholder now handles the second time interval:
            - 10 CALL NTIME(JRDDAY(2),RDTIM(2),DEL2)
      - An interpolation ratio (RRATIO) is computed to interpolate between two sets of pre-calculated flow values.  
      - The routine then enters a loop that processes each basin (or sub-basin) from 1 to NOW. For each basin with valid curve and area values:
            - It calculates an interpolated flow value (FFLOW) across three components by linearly interpolating between two given states.
            - The flow is adjusted using the basin area (SEWAREA) and a month-based correction factor from RDIIR.
            - The running total flow is accumulated in an array (CNTRDII) and the final flow value for that basin is stored in the FLOWII array.
            
- **Additional Notes:**  
      - Commented WRITE statements in the code indicate that debugging printouts were once used to monitor values of time intervals and flow computations.
      - The structure follows typical Fortran programming practices, using DO loops, IF conditions, and INCLUDE statements to build up its functionality.

### Overall Functionality
The RDIISHED subroutine is crucial for managing runoff and hydrological calculations in basin simulations. It ensures that time intervals are correctly determined and that flow values are accurately interpolated and adjusted based on dynamic inputs such as basin area and calibration factors. The updated call to NTIME at the placeholder ensures that the second time interval (DEL2) is correctly processed, contributing to the fidelity of the simulation.
