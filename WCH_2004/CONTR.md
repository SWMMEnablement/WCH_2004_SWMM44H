      ### Overview

      This file contains Fortran code defining a set of common blocks that enable shared variable access across various modules in the SWMM simulation software. The common blocks provide critical parameters for:
      - Maintaining simulation time and scheduling.
      - Managing simulation control flags and time increments.
      - Controlling advanced routing, including drawdown, flow tolerances, and optional weights.

      ### Common Block Definitions

      #### EXTRAN Block

      - **Purpose:**  
            The EXTRAN block sets up variables for general simulation control, including timekeeping and configuration flags.
            
      - **Key Variables:**
            - `XTIME`: A double-precision variable for high-accuracy time tracking.
            - `DELT`, `DELT2`, `TIME`, `TIME2`, `RDELT`: Real variables managing time increments.
            - Control variables such as `IDATZ`, `MJSW`, `JSLOT`, `NJ`, `NC`, `NTC`, etc., that structure the simulation flow.
            - `ALPHA1` and `ALPHA2`: Character arrays (80 characters) that may store parameter labels or additional configuration details.

      #### Routing Blocks

      - **COMMON /ROUTE4/ Block:**
            - **Purpose:**  
                  Handles routing tolerance settings which are crucial for the simulation's flow calculations.
            - **Key Variables:**  
                  `TOLCS1`, `TOLCS2` (tolerances), `QLOWCS` (flow threshold), and `KREDO` (control flag).

      - **COMMON /ROUTE4A/ Block:**
            - **Purpose:**  
                  Extends routing setups by managing new input parameters for advanced routing configurations.
            - **Key Variables:**  
                  Includes `NOROUT`, `NEWQIN`, `NEWQTAPE`, `NEWQCARD`, and `ISOLSKIP` for adjusting routing conditions.

      #### Additional Routing and Drawdown Blocks

      - **COMMON /ROUTE5/ Block:**
            - **Purpose:**  
                  Specifically handles variables related to drawdown conditions, particularly for M1 scenarios.
            - **Key Variables:**  
                  Generally dynamically defined variables such as `IM2` related to drawdown correction.

      - **COMMON /ROUTE6/ Block:**
            - **Purpose:**  
                  Introduces optional weights in simulation for parameters such as head and additional flow considerations.
            - **Key Variables:**
                  - Weight arrays: `WUP(3)`, `WMD(3)`, `WDN(3)`
                  - Additional parameters: `NAVER` and `NFASNH` for weight averaging and other optional settings.

      ### Summary

      This extensive summary and transformation into markdown format provides both a structured explanation and the complete source code listing. Key aspects covered include:

      - A detailed breakdown of how each common block is leveraged:
            - EXTRAN for time control and simulation settings.
            - Route blocks (ROUTE4 / ROUTE4A) for advanced flow and tolerance management.
            - ROUTE5/ROUTE6 for specialized handling of drawdown and weighting configurations.
            
      - Clear demarcation of code sections, allowing easier navigation and maintenance of legacy Fortran code within the SWMM simulation framework.

      This markdown serves as both a reference and documentation for developers working on maintaining or updating the simulation software.

      The file defines multiple common blocks used for:
      - **Time Keeping and Control Parameters:** The `/CONTR/` block includes variables for simulation time, time increments, and various control parameters.
      - **Routing and Drawdown Handling:** Blocks such as `/ROUTE5/` and `/ROUTE6/` include variables for routing, drawdown conditions, and optional weight factors.
      - **Extended Routing Settings:** The additional routing common blocks `/ROUTE4/` and `/ROUTE4A/` help manage refined routing conditions, including threshold limits and new input configurations.

      ## Detailed Analysis

      ### 1. The EXTRAN Block

      - **Purpose:**  
            Defines shared variables used for simulation control â€” including time keeping, control flags, and cycle settings.

      - **Key Variables:**  
            - `XTIME` is defined with double precision for higher accuracy in time tracking.
            - `IDATZ`, `MJSW`, `JSLOT`, and several cycle and routing flags manage program flow.

      ### 2. Additional Routing Blocks

      The additional routing configuration is introduced later and includes the following two sections:

      - **COMMON /ROUTE4/ Block:**  
            Declares variables such as `TOLCS1`, `TOLCS2`, `QLOWCS`, and `KREDO` for handling specific routing tolerances and flow controls.

      - **COMMON /ROUTE4A/ Block:**  
            Declares variables such as `NOROUT`, `NEWQIN`, `NEWQTAPE`, `NEWQCARD`, and `ISOLSKIP` for advanced routing input management.

      ### 3. Other Common Blocks

      - **COMMON /ROUTE5/ Block:**  
            Manages variables for scenarios such as handling M1 drawdown conditions.

      - **COMMON /ROUTE6/ Block:**  
            Contains optional weight variables (`WUP`, `WMD`, `WDN`) and additional parameters (`NAVER`, `NFASNH`).
