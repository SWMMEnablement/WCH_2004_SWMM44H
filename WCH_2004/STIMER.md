      This file contains Fortran code that defines a common block named `STIMER`. The common block is used to share a set of variables across multiple program units without having to pass them explicitly.

      ## Fortran Code Details

      The Fortran code snippet is:

      ```fortran
            COMMON/STIMER/TIMDAY,JULDAY,NYEAR,MONTH,NDAY,JHR,MINUTE,JSEC
      ```

      ### Variables Explained

      - **TIMDAY**: Likely represents the time of the day in a specific format (possibly a floating-point representation of the day fraction).
      - **JULDAY**: Likely the Julian day, which is a continuous count of days since a starting epoch.
      - **NYEAR**: Represents the year. Typically, this is stored as an integer.
      - **MONTH**: Represents the month. Stored as an integer ranging from 1 to 12.
      - **NDAY**: Represents the day number of the month.
      - **JHR**: Represents the hour. It is probably used to hold the current hour in a day.
      - **MINUTE**: Represents the current minute value.
      - **JSEC**: Represents the seconds value.

      ## Purpose of the Common Block

      The `COMMON /STIMER/` block is designed for time management within the application, storing various components of date and time. Because these variables are declared in a common block, they can be accessed and modified by any part of the program that includes this declaration. This technique is useful for synchronizing time-related information across different modules of a legacy Fortran program.

      ## Usage in Legacy Fortran Code

      - **Shared Variables:** Common blocks were a common approach in Fortran to share data among subroutines and functions before the advent of more structured programming paradigms in later versions of Fortran.
      - **Data Synchronization:** By using a common block, all parts of the program reference the exact same memory location for time variables, ensuring consistent behavior.
      - **Legacy Code Considerations:** Modern Fortran programs might use modules to encapsulate data, but many legacy systems continue to use common blocks.

      ## Conclusion

      This markdown summary explains the role and structure of the `STIMER` common block in a legacy Fortran application. It provides an understanding of how shared time-related data is maintained and used throughout the code, offering context for anyone reviewing or maintaining the legacy system.
