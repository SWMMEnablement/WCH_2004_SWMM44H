It contains a FORTRAN COMMON block definition which sets up shared data structures for simulation parameters.

## Code Snippet

```fortran
  COMMON/BND/JFREE(NTG),JTIDE(NTG),JGATE(NTG),NBCF(NTG),

   CHARACTER*10 KFREE,KGATE
```

## Detailed Summary

- **Purpose**:  
  This FORTRAN code declares a COMMON block named `BND` which is used to share variables among multiple program units, a common practice in legacy scientific and engineering applications.

- **Variables Declaration**:  
  - `JFREE`, `JTIDE`, `JGATE`: Arrays of size `NTG`, likely representing indices or flags for different boundary conditions such as free surface, tidal inputs, or gate operations.
  - `NBCF`, `NBCG`: Arrays of size `NTG`, possibly holding boundary counts or configuration codes for respective conditions.
  - `NFREE`, `NGATE`: Scalar variables that likely keep a count or flag for free conditions and gate conditions.
  - `KFREE`, `KGATE`: Arrays of size `NTG` declared with a fixed-length of 10 characters each, used to store string identifiers or labels associated with the free surface and gate properties.

- **Usage Context**:  
  This structure is likely part of a larger hydrological or hydraulic simulation program, where sharing these common variables across different program segments ensures consistency in boundary condition handling.

This extended summary is intended to give you a clear picture of the structure and purpose of the code within the context of the simulation model.
