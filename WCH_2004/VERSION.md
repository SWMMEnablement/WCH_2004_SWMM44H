# VERSION Subroutine Documentation

This markdown document provides a comprehensive summary of the `VERSION` subroutine used for managing program version numbers. Below is an extensive overview of its components and functionality.

## Overview

The `VERSION` subroutine is designed to centralize and simplify the process of updating and tracking the program's version information. Key information includes:
- **Version Number:** Stored as a 6-character string in the variable `VERID`.
- **Detailed Description:** A 45-character string array `DESTRING` containing additional information about the version, including release date, contributing organizations, and compilation details.

## Key Components

### 1. Subroutine Declaration and Purpose
- **Subroutine Name:** `VERSION`
- **Objective:** To embed version tracking information directly within the code to maintain consistency across various program modules.

### 2. Version Information
- **Primary Variable (`VERID`):** Contains the version number (e.g., `'4.4H'`).
- **Detailed Description (`DESTRING`):** Includes multiple lines of descriptive text that specify:
      - The development history involving organizations like CDM/OSU.
      - The release date (e.g., "July 23, 2004").
      - Additional credits including universities and contributing individuals.

### 3. Inclusion of External Files
- **VERSION.INC:** An external include file which might contain shared constants, parameters, or auxiliary version details necessary for the subroutine.

### 4. Compilation Note
- The source mentions differing compilation methods over time. This is evident from the commented lines, reflecting transitions (e.g., from KAI GUIDE to Compaq Visual Fortran v.6.6).

## Intended Usage

- **Maintenance:** Simplifies updating version numbers and related metadata when the software undergoes revisions.
- **Documentation:** Acts as a single source of truth for version information, ensuring that the latest version details are readily accessible and consistent across different parts of the application.
- **Historical Reference:** Provides a snapshot of the version's metadata and context, including development dates and contributing parties.

## Code Reference
Below is the original Fortran code for context:
