1. 10/11/99, C. Moore.  Yroute: Correct C. Moore correction at line 118 
to make akon = -1.0000001

The next changes, 2-13, were made about 10/15/99 by Chuck Moore:

2.  Subroutine CATCH around line 90.  Change loop from 900 to NW.

3. In GETCUR, you put in a check for raising zero to a power around line 443.  This check is not needed if you do not turn the Fortran runtime power operations project setting on.  This gives error if you raise a zero to a zero or a negative real number to a real power (e.g.:  -2.3**2.0 is not valid but -2.3**2 is)  I think that there is no need to use this switch.

4. In GROUND near line 54 you put in checks that are not needed if the
power operations project setting run time error is not used.

5. In GUTNR at two locations near line 171 and 179 you put in two checks 
that are not need if power operations check is not used.

6. I made some minor changes to INDAT1 that you should probably include..  
A comment near line 1756, tests for zu less than z at line 1934 and 1963.  
Change to format number 5270 and 5271 and added formats 8050 and 8055 to 
provide error statement for negative zp.  

7. INDAT2 near lines 1127 and 1140.  I added option for reading pon and 
poff for type 4 pumps but have commented them out in my version due to
incompatibility issues with MIKE.  These have been tested and I think 
that these should be in your version.  See documentation in 
the EXTRAN44.DOC file.

8. In OUTPUT.FOR near line 48.  We found that models that had both input 
from unformatted sequential and from K_ line produced a NAN in the 
continuity summary.  NAN stands for Not-a-number.  From the online 
reference "Not a Number (NaN) results from an operation involving 
one or more invalid operands. For instance 0/0 and SQRT ( - 1) result 
in NaN. In general, an operation involving a NaN produces another NaN."  
The check in OUTPUT is a patch that seems to work.  I didn't have time to 
go back an trace where exactly the NAN is occurring in the computations.  
Also have a check for case where node has a positive QQI and negative QOU.  
This occurs when you are loading a storage junction that is also 
overflowing and results in large continuity errors.  Again this is a 
patch for some other problem somewhere in the bowels of the code.  Best 
way to prevent this is to not load storage nodes that surcharge to land 
surface elevations.

9. QSHED near line 197 you put in check for power operation that is not
needed.

10.  RDIIRES.  I changed format on statements 7010 and 7011 to make things 
line up. (28X to 32X). This was needed because I changed width of 
subcatchment ID's in first line of statement.

11. RHYDRO1 near line 332.  Changed loop from 900 to NG. Yes people are
running models with more than 9000 catchments and conduits!

12. STRIP near 72.  Added zeros to end of H1 lines in EXTRAN.  Used for
optional input of JON and JOFF for pump type 4.  (see comments 7 above).

13. wrtflow.for.  Changed format statement 7000 to prevent wrapping.

---------

14. HCURVE, change for correct printing of rainfall hyetograph over
long time periods.  WCH, 11/10/99

24. In RUNOFF.FOR, fix subscript error during initialization.  WCH, 3/27/00.

24. Create uniform default starting date of 19410802 (YearMoDay) in all 
blocks.  Will be used if user inputs zeros for any date.  WCH, 3/27/00.

25. Metric corrections in BRIDGES print-outs, WCH, 3/28/00.

26. Fix metric conversion and other typo involving gravity in INDAT1, 
for computation of equivalent roughness.  WCH, 3/28/00.  (This typo found 
by swmm-user Junshan Su.)  

27. Fix metric rainfall conversion problem with Runoff Block RDII routine 
(Sub. RDIIRES).  WCH, 3/28/00.

28. Let Temp Block read 4-digit years from NWS data (Sub. GTCOLD).
WCH, 3/28/00.

option and check for model with no boundaries.  CIM, 4/10/00.

33. Fix variable LONG on Runoff line B3 to read last digit of 
year-month-day format.  WCH, 4/11/00.

34. Fix metric conversion for type 23 weir element in Transport 
(Sub INTRAN).  But use of weir element is discouraged.  Use general 
Type 26 rating curve flow divider instead.  WCH, 8/10/00.  

35. Minor corrections in Transport Sub. CIRCLE to improve convergence
(courtesy Sandy Elliot, NIWAR, New Zealand) and typo in Runoff Sub. GUTTER
(courtesy Andy Rowen, Rutgers Univ.).  WCH, 8/10/00.

36. Fix minor typos in SLOP and WRTFLOW that apparently have not affected
execution.  (Courtesy Prof. Jehng-Jung Kao, National Chiao Tung Univ., 
Taiwan)  WCH, 8/15/00

37. Input error checks in Trans Block Sub. INTRAN in case of missing
constant pollutant concentrations in E1 lines and missing pollutant
info in F1 lines.  WCH, 8/29/00.

38. Changes to output format of TRANS.FOR to enhance readability of output
from hydraulic design routine.  WCH, 8/29/00.

39. Fix output error for headings in Runoff Sub. PRFLOW.  WCH, 9/7/00.

40. Correct array initialization in Extran Sub. TRANSX to get correct
continuity check when using hotstart.  WCH from RED, 9/8/00.

41. Metricate header and add column headers for Extran ASCII output
file for channel flows.  WCH, 9/8/00.

**The following four changes (42-45) were supplied by Chuck Moore, 
CDM, 9/8/00.  Additional documentation is in the Word file 
CDM9-8-99.DOC, included in CDM-DOC.ZIP.  .  

42. TRANSPORT IRREGULAR SECTIONS :   By default, TRANSPORT subdivides 
sections into 25 equal-area segments. For irregular sections that 
include large overbank areas, the lowermost equal area-segment can 
include the entire incised stream channel.  An option was added to 
break the lowermost equal-area segment into 25 additional segments.  
This option is invoked by IDETAIL on B0 input line.  This is 
documented in TRANS.DOC.  Most useful if you are driving WASP 
from TRANSPORT or are using TRANSPORT velocities to evaluate 
stream velocities and scour potential.  

43. TRANSPORT DEPTH AND VELOCITY:  Add option to have TRANSPORT 
output head and velocity to the interface file for statistical 
analysis.  Controlled by negative NPOLL on B1 line.   Documented 
in TRANS.DOC.

44.	EXTRAN CRITICAL ELEVATION COMPARISON:  Add optional D2 and D3 
line to read elevations against which junction elevations will be 
compared and reported.  Documented in EXTRAN.DOC

45.	RDII METRICATION:  Changes to make RDII calculations and 
continuity check correct when working in metric units.  I notice 
that Dr. Huber did some changes also.  In this version area remains 
in hectares and rainfall in mm.  Flows are computed in CFS.  
I'm pretty sure that my changes work.  Continuity error check is 
correct also.

Necessary for some Graph Block input, and useful for wrap-around data for 
all blocks.  WCH, 9/14/00.

47. Change Sub. GRAPH to correct metric error and add error message.

71. Raise limit on number of subcatchment numbers for snowmelt input
in Runoff Sub. SNOWIN.  RED, 5/20/01.

72. Close scratch files when exiting Runoff, in Sub. RUNOFF.  This

entered. An error message is printed so user can change to desired slope 
if need be.  Affects Extran and Transport.  WCH, 4/16/02.

91. Add error message for incompatible alphanumeric option ($ANUM) between
blocks.  Subs. INTRAN, INDAT3, STRT.  WCH, 4/18/02.

lines among the subcatchment input stream) and add additional GW time
series output (inflow, outflow, ET) to time-step output.  WCH, 7/1/03.

97. Fix minimum equivalent orifice length in Extran (Sub. INFLOW) to be
200 ft or 200/3.28 m.  WCH, 7/2/03.

98. Fix S/T interpolation routines off interface file for too many
metric conversions for pollutant loads.  WCH, 11/24/03.

99. Fix STATS computation of average flow for units of depth/time.  
WCH, 11/24/03.  Otherwise need to multiply average flows by 3600 sec/hr 
when requesting output in depth/time. 

100. Fix index in Sub ROUTE related to using correct QCURVE2 array for
low-flow calcs in power and natural channels in Transport.  
CIM, 7/20/04.

101. Fix format for Transport output for natural and power channels in
Sub GETCUR. CIM, 7/20/04.

108. For Extran case when downstream junction is critical or ,
supercritical add all surface area to upstream junction, not 
just half. Sub. NHEAD. WCH (RED), 7/20/04.  

109. For Extran subcritical flow with downstream junction near
